# AIML-Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), which I pursued as part of the certificate program from Great Lakes. Each project focuses on a specific aspect of AIML, including Applied Statistics, Supervised Learning, Ensemble Techniques, Unsupervised Learning, Feature Engineering, Neural Networks(NN), Computer Vision(CV), and Natural Language Processing(NLP).

### **NLP (Sequential_NLP):** 

Through this Natural Language Processing (NLP) project, I developed expertise in implementing sequential NLP-based text classifiers for distinct industry applications. In the digital content and entertainment realm, I constructed a sentiment classifier leveraging customer reviews from the IMDB database, employing techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and word embeddings like GloVe. Additionally, for a social media analytics company, I designed a sarcasm detection system utilizing similar sequential NLP methodologies. This project honed my skills in RNN, LSTM, and classification and provided hands-on experience with TensorFlow, facilitating the effective analysis of textual data for sentiment assessment and sarcasm detection in real-world contexts.

### **Neural Networks & Deep Learning:**

Throughout the "Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning" project, I delved into the realms of electronics and telecommunication, mastering the intricacies of neural networks and deep learning methodologies. My journey culminated in two significant sub-projects. In Part 1, I crafted a neural network regressor and classifier tailored for a communications equipment manufacturer. Leveraging TensorFlow, the model adeptly predicted signal quality based on diverse product parameters, crucial for emitting informative signals. Part 2 saw me develop an image classifier capable of discerning numbers from street-level photographs, employing sophisticated neural network architectures. This immersive experience honed my skills in image recognition and solidified my understanding of applying neural networks in real-world scenarios, marking a significant achievement in my learning journey.
