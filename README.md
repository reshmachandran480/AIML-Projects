# AIML-Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects related to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML). Each project focuses on a specific aspect of AIML, including Applied Statistics, Supervised Learning, Ensemble Techniques, Unsupervised Learning, Feature Engineering, Neural Networks(NN), Computer Vision(CV), and Natural Language Processing(NLP).

**NLP (Sequential_NLP):** Through this Natural Language Processing (NLP) project, I developed expertise in implementing sequential NLP-based text classifiers for distinct industry applications. In the digital content and entertainment realm, I constructed a sentiment classifier leveraging customer reviews from the IMDB database, employing techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and word embeddings like GloVe. Additionally, for a social media analytics company, I designed a sarcasm detection system utilizing similar sequential NLP methodologies. This project not only honed my skills in RNN, LSTM, and classification but also provided hands-on experience with TensorFlow, facilitating the effective analysis of textual data for sentiment assessment and sarcasm detection in real-world contexts.
